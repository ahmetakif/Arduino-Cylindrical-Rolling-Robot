# Arduino-Cylindrical-Rolling-Robot
If you want to play with something unconventional you could make your own, like this robot. It is not difficult to make this from scratch, only you need to use:

2x big jar lid (for wheels),

1x cylindrical wafer box or something like that (for the trunk of robot)

1x small jar lid (to cover one side of wafer box)

2x dc motor with gearboxes (you could find them in most of the toys, i took them from two little toy tank)

1x 4.8v Ni-Cd battery for powering motors (or 4 AA battery)

1x 9v battery to power the arduino

1x arduino uno clone

1x hc-06 bluetooth module

1x l293d motor driver (or some transistors and diodes with an appropriate h bridge)

1x 5 kohm and 1x 10 kohm resistors (to decrease the voltage to 3.3v for rx pin of bluetooth module)

1x small breadboard or perfboard

Some wires

Insulation tape for covering

Arduino power plug and 9v battery connetor
